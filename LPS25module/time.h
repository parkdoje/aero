// These functions assume that the PIC is running at 48 MHz, so _XTAL_FREQ
// would be 48000000.

// module.
void timeInit(void);

// This function should be called frequently if you are using millis().
// To ensure that millis() does not lose counts, you must call this at least
// every 170 ms.  The value of millis() only changes when this is called.

// Returns a measurement of the time since timeInit was called, in milliseconds.
// This starts at 0 and counts up, resetting to 0 after about 49 days.

// Returns a higher resolution representation of the time since timeInit was called.  This starts at 0
// and counts up, and then resets to 0 after reaching 65535.
